# MyRecipes sample application

Based on the "Professional Ruby on Rails Developer with Rails 5" course on Udemy.

## Getting started

First of all, do you have ruby v2.75 and rails v6.1.5 installed with mysql?
IMPORTANT: When setting up mysql, please create a password to connect to your local database. You will need this password later when setting up database credentials.

- Rails install for Windows 10: https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10
- Rails install for macOS: https://gorails.com/setup/osx/12-monterey

Do you have node? If not, install that too (version of node doesn't matter):

- Node install: https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm/

---

IMPORTANT: Before proceeding, make sure that `ruby -v` returns `2.7.5` and `rails -v` returns `6.1.5`.

---

To get started with the app, clone the repo and `cd` into the directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/coderdave/myrecipes.git
$ cd myrecipes
$ git checkout initial
```

---

IMPORTANT: Switch to the `initial` branch. You will branch off from here to do your work for the Udemy course.

---

After switching to the `initial` branch, install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Install JavaScript dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Next, your local mysql database is expecting a password. If you want, check out the `database.yml` file for details on how rails connects to mysql. To set up credentials for the development database, run the following command:

```
$ EDITOR='code --wait' rails credentials:edit --environment development
```

VS Code will open to the credentials configuration file for development. Now insert the following with the password you set for mysql when you installed it.

```
mysql:
  db_password: your_password
```

Then, to set up credentials for the test database, run the following command:

```
$ EDITOR='code --wait' rails credentials:edit --environment test
```

Again, insert the same information you entered for the development database.

```
mysql:
  db_password: your_password
```

After setting up credentials, create the database:

```
$ rails db:create
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

Open up your favorite browser (I hope it's Chrome!) and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

Create your own branch and start the Udemy course!
